The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a sample text file for testing the FaF speed reader application.

Speed reading is a technique that allows you to read faster while maintaining comprehension. The RSVP method displays one word at a time, reducing eye movement and increasing reading speed.

This file contains multiple paragraphs to test paragraph detection and navigation. Each paragraph should be identified correctly by the parser.

The final paragraph tests that we can reach the end of the document and handle the completion state properly.
